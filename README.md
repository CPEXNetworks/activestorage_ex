# ActivestorageEx

This project was started with the intention of easing the transition between a Rails project and an Elixir one.

Since this is being created with our needs in mind, it'll start by only allowing reads and creating variations from the local file system and AWS S3. Direct uploads and other providers may come in future, but they aren't an immediate goal.
